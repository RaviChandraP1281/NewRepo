Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I'm sorry to trouble you, but I have recently been assigned your QuickBooks account and need your help resolving a decline for your account. Would you be so kind as to tell me a good time and number to call to discuss your billing account, or is there someone else I should reach out to? 

Thank you,
