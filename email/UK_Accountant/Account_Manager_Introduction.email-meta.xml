    <subject>Welcome to QuickBooks</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your time today. It was great getting to know more about your business and I&apos;m looking forward to helping you take your clients to the cloud using QuickBooks.

We covered it briefly in our conversation earlier, but I thought it useful to list some of the benefits you&apos;ll experience through our partner programme:
 
• 	Free QuickBooks training (which can take place in a classroom or remotely), ensuring you get up to speed with the product
• 	Free, UK based telephone support from 8am-8pm
• 	Access to &quot;Accountant only&quot; discounts on QuickBooks Online for your clients
• 	Migrate your clients data for free
 
Getting the most out of QuickBooks couldn&apos;t be easier, and there are two way that will help you to get started.

Our weekly webinars are a great way of getting a comprehensive overview of the product, as well as providing you with an opportunity to ask any pressing questions.

Don&apos;t have time for a webinar? Then take a look at our QuickBooks Online Accountant Welcome Guide.

Once again, thank you for choosing QuickBooks. I&apos;d be more than happy to speak with you again if you had any questions, so feel free to contact me via the details below.
 
Kind regards,
Aqueel Rahman,
Your dedicated QuickBooks Account Manager
