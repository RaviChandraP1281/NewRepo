Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this e-mail finds you well. 

This is Valenn from QuickBooks Online Care team. I understand that you might have been busy. I just want to follow up and check if you received my previous email and if that took care of the issue. The case is scheduled for closure in the next 2 days. Before closure I want to make sure that all your queries are well addressed. It would be great if you can shoot me an e-mail if you have further queries and clarification.

Thank you and have a great day!


Best regards,
