Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am contacting you because you recently chatted with one of our agents online about our QuickBooks  product. I apologize for the delay in response time. I wanted to get in contact so that we can discuss your needs a bit more, along with available options and pricing that fit your business.  When would be a good time to get in touch with you to discuss this? 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,
