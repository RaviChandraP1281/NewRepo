Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Please forgive the late reply.  I am sending you this email regarding the chat you had with one of our agents some time ago. I have been assigned to your Account this morning and I would like to schedule a time for us to talk regarding our QuickBooks products and what would best fit your business needs. Please give me a call or send me an email with an appropriate time and date that we can talk. 

I look forward to speaking with you!
