    <textOnly>Hi 
Here is a guide to walk you through the set up for Intuit Merchant Services with your QuickBooks online software. If you have questions please contact Merchant Support at 800-558-9558.

1.	Sign into the QuickBooks Online company file to which you want to link an existing payments account (which may be a QuickBooks, GoPayment, or eCommerce account.)
 
2.	Click the gear icon   in the upper right hand corner of QuickBooks Online company file (in earlier versions, click the Company tab).
 
3.	Click Company Settings and then click Payments (in earlier versions select Preferences and then click Accept Credit Cards).
             Note: To activate a new account, click QuickBooks Payments and follow the instructions to choose the plan you want.

4.	If you already have a Payments account, click Connect in the Use Existing account section. 
 
5.	Click the start here link and enter the login credentials for the payments account you want to link.
           Note: If this Payments account is already linked to another company file, you will receive a message stating that you won&apos;t be able to process transactions with the original company. In other words, you can only link a payments account to one company file at a time.

IMPORTANT: After you link the payments account to QuickBooks Online, the login for the payments account will change to match the login used to open the QuickBooks Online company file.   

A new window will appear asking you to confirm the payments account to be linked.

6. If the correct payments account is displayed, click the Link account button to continue.

7. If there are multiple payments accounts linked to this login, click on Choose a different account to link to select a different payments account.
    
 8. Once the payments account is linked, you return to the QuickBooks Online Preferences screen.
Note: You may need to log out of your QuickBooks company file and then log back in for the changes to take effect.

Congratulations! You&apos;re ready to start processing credit cards (see Processing a Payment in QuickBooks Online).

IMPORTANT: If the payments account you are linking includes GoPayment processing, make sure the QuickBooks Online login is in correct email format to ensure everything works correctly. GoPayment requires that all associated logins be in correct email format (e.g., someone@something.com). See Problem logging in to GoPayment for more information.</textOnly>
