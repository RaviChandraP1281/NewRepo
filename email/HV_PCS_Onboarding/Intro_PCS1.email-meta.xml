Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on your purchase of QuickBooks Payment Solutions. We’ve recently developed a new onboarding program that’s included with your purchase. As your Onboarding Account Manager, I will be working with you to link and train you on your new QuickBooks Payments. Here’s a quick overview of what the program looks like.
Onboarding Account Manager: As your primary contact, I will learn your general business needs and help to guide you through the transition to Intuit Payments.

Link: If you haven’t already linked your payments account, I will walk you through linking your Merchant Services to your QuickBooks.

Training: We will walk you through your first real transaction to ensure that you are comfortable and confident when accepting payments.  We will also walk you through your first reconciliation training and provide resources for your reference.
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks for your time and have a great day!
