    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},


It’s your Onboarding Specialist here checking in to see how things are going with the implementation of QuickBooks. I know it can be a lot of work to get everything up and running and I’d like to help you in any way possible. I’m here for you for install, training, support and really anything you can think of during set up and implementation.


I just tried leaving you a voicemail but I figured it might be easier for you to communicate via email. If you could let me know how things are going and where you are in terms of being fully up and ready to go I’d greatly appreciate it.



I hope all is well, and if there is anything you need just let me know!
