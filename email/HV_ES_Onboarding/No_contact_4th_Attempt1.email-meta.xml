Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I’m kindly asking for a moment of your time to cover the benefits of the Enterprise Onboarding Process that you’re currently missing out on.

Onboarding Account Manager: As your primary contact, I learn your specific business needs and guide you through the transition to QuickBooks. This could save you valuable time that may be otherwise lost searching for the correct individuals, departments or third-party partners.

Installation: An Installation Expert will take you step-by-step through a customized installation process, saving you time and potential frustration through the technical aspects of this process.

Data Migration: Your Installation Expert will work with you to transfer data from your existing accounting software, minimizing manual entry that can take weeks or even months without their assistance.

Training: I will assist you in customizing our training program to meet your specific needs. You’ll receive exclusive 1-on-1 QuickBooks training sessions with an Enterprise Expert that could save you time and money, while also helping you to avoid costly common mistakes in the future.

Please reach out to me to take advantage of this process.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.
