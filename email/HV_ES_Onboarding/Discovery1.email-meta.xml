Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

When you have time, Iâ€™ve put together a handful of questions to get a better understanding of your business and how you are going use QuickBooks so that I can better serve you:

1) What accounting software  are you currently using?

2) Does {!Account.Name} have multiple locations that will use QuickBooks?
2a) If so, should we have the other address(es) on file?

3) How many employees do you currently have?
3a) How many use QuickBooks?
4) What will the company primarily use QuickBooks for? (e.g. Reporting, Invoicing, Inventory, Payroll)

6)   Is {!Account.Name} affiliated with any other company that uses QuickBooks?

7) Do you have a preferred time and/or method of contact?
If you need any clarification to my questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Also feel free to add any pertinent information or questions that you have for me.

Thanks and have a great day, I look forward to working with you.
