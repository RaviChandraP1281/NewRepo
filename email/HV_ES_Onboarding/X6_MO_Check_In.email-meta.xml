Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


Just wanted to check in to see how things are going with your QuickBooks Enterprise. I know that you have now been using the software for about 6 months and wanted to see if you have any other questions I can answer for you.

If you would please let me know how things are going as well as if there is anything that you need.

Thank you,
