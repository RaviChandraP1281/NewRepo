Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on your purchase of QuickBooks Enterprise 2016 through Intuit. We’ve recently developed a new 60 day program that’s included with your purchase. As your Onboarding Account Manager, I will be working with you throughout the Enterprise Onboarding Program. Here’s a quick overview of what the program looks like.

Onboarding Account Manager: As your primary contact, I will learn your general business needs and help to guide you through the transition to QuickBooks Enterprise 2016.

Installation: If you haven’t self-installed the software already and would like to work with an Installation Expert, they can take you step-by-step through the installation process. (Call or email me if you have a day &amp; time in mind. Please note that my team typically needs a 24 hour notice and is available between 7:00 AM &amp; 3:00 PM PST)

Data Migration: Your Installation Expert can also work with you on the best procedures to transfer data from your existing accounting software.

Training: You have the option to receive, at no additional charge, unlimited (1 hour) QuickBooks training sessions that will be 1-on-1 with an Enterprise Expert. I can assist you in customizing our training program to meet your needs. If you’d like a list of the training options we offer, let me know and I’d be happy to email it to you.
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks for your time and have a great day!
