Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I attempted to reach you a few times by phone and email. I do not want to bother you, as such I want to give you all of my contact information in case you ever wanted to reach out to me.

If you know of any co-workers that might benefit from working with me please forward my information to them.

I would greatly appreciate a moment to discuss with you and/or the other primary QuickBooks user(s), the benefits of the Onboarding Program. I look forward to speaking with you or your co-worker.

We at Intuit value your business and are continuously working to improve the experience we provide to our valued customers and are excited to offer you this new benefit.

I look forward to working with you.
