Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You’re allotted unlimited (1 hour) QuickBooks training sessions that will be 1-on-1 with an Enterprise Expert during the Onboarding Program. We’ve developed nine different offerings and one session that would be completely driven by whatever questions you bring. Take a look below and let me know where you’d prefer to start. My team typically needs a 24 hour notice prior to scheduling the training, all courses are an hour long, and scheduled on the hour between 7:00 AM – 3:00 PM (Pacific Time), Monday through Friday.
