Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I attempted to reach you by phone today but unfortunately missed you again. What date and time works best for you so that I can accommodate your busy schedule?

If you would prefer that I work with someone else during the installation of QuickBooks, your help in directing me to them would be greatly appreciated!

It’s important that we get you successfully transitioned to your new QuickBooks Enterprise software as quickly and efficiently as possible to minimize interruption of your business.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

I look forward to helping you successfully transition to your new QuickBooks Enterprise Software.
