Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I apologize if all of my attempts to reach you have become an annoyance, it is however crucial that I stress the importance and urgency of this process.

I hope that you, a coworker, or a consultant thatâ€™s assisting you, is able to find time to reach out to me this week so that I can ensure that you are well taken care of. It is my primary goal to ensure your successful installation and implementation of your new QuickBooks Enterprise software.

Thanks for your time and response,
