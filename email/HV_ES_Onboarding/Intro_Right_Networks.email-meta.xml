Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on your purchase of QuickBooks Enterprise 2016 through Intuit. We’ve recently developed a new 60 day program that’s included with your purchase. As your Onboarding Account Manager, I will be working with you throughout the Enterprise Onboarding Program. Here’s a quick overview of what the program looks like.Onboarding Account Manager: As your primary contact, I will learn your general business needs and help to guide you through the transition to QuickBooks Enterprise 2016.

Installation: Right Networks will or may have already taken you step-by-step through the hosted installation process. You should have received an automated email with their phone number and first steps that you’ll be taking with them but if by chance you didn’t receive it, their number is 888-417-4448.

Data Migration: Once your Installation process has been completed, my team can also work with you on the best procedures to transfer data from your existing accounting software.

Training: You have the option to receive, at no additional charge, QuickBooks training sessions that will be 1-on-1 with an Enterprise Expert. I can assist you in customizing our training program to meet your needs. If you’d like a list of the training options we offer, let me know and I’d be happy to email it to you.


If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me..

I look forward to working with you.
