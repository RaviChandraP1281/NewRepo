Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting QuickBooks Online Support team, how are you doing today?

To answer your question, yes there is a known issue about clients that can’t access suppliers and stuffs. We have taken actions for this and we are now trying our best to fix this issue. There is however a work around, you just need to click on the supplier tab and search the name of the supplier on the Search box so that it’ll show. From there you can click on the supplier name and it’s should route you inside the supplier profile which will allow you to create transaction just for this specific supplier.

Please let me know if you have further queries by replying to this email and I look forward to hearing from you again.
