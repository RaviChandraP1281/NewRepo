    <subject>Confirmed: Your Payments with QuickBooks Plus Offer</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

This email is to confirm that you have accepted the special Payments with QuickBooks Plus offer. As part of the offer, you have consented to a $45 monthly minimum to your existing Payments account. (It’s simply a minimum in transaction fees you are required to pay every month.) Please remember that  if you change (upgrade/downgrade/cancel) your Payments account, you may no longer be eligible and will be required to pay separately to continue your QuickBooks Plus subscription. See below for complete offer disclosures. Thanks for being a QuickBooks customer!


Regards,
Intuit QuickBooks Payments







As a QuickBooks Payments customer on $19.95 monthly plan, you can get QuickBooks Plus Pro with 3 licensed seats ($699.95 annual value), or QuickBooks Plus Premier with 5 licensed seats ($1,699.95 annual value) included at no additional cost when you commit to a minimum monthly volume of $45 in Payments transaction processing fees.  When your monthly processing volume results in transaction fees totaling less than $45, we’ll bill your account the difference for a total monthly charge of $45; and when your monthly processing volume results in transaction fees exceeding the $45 minimum, you’ve met your minimum and will simply pay your transaction fees. This special minimum pricing is available only as part of a advertised bundle and only for as long as you maintain your $19.95 Payments plan in good standing.  If you change (cancel/upgrade/downgrade) your Payments plan, you may no longer be eligible for this offer and will be required to pay separately to continue your QuickBooks Plus subscription..  Limit: one offer per customer.  You may cancel or change your Payments subscription or participation in this offer at any time by calling 800-558-9558. Terms, conditions, prices, payment, features and services are subject to change and offer may not be assigned, exchanged, sold, transferred, combined with other offers, or redeemed for cash or other goods and services not expressly stated here.</textOnly>
