Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I understand that you might have been busy but I wanted to follow up and check if you received my previous email and if that took care of the issue. Should I not hear back from you in the next 2 days, this case will automatically close, but replying to this email will leave your ticket in an "Open" status until we get to a resolution. 

Please feel free to drop me a message should you require further assistance. In the meantime take care and have a fantastic day !
