Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
Thanks for your time today. I enjoyed our phone conversation and especially liked learning about your firm. I understand the challenges you are facing with moving your firm to the cloud. We anticipate that almost 80% of US small businesses will be fully cloud operational by 2020, and accountants who use QBOA save on average 8 hours per client per month.¹
As promised, here are articles on five advantages of shifting to cloud technology
