    <subject>The Impact of Value Billing</subject>
    <textOnly>Intuit


Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
Thanks for your time today. I enjoyed our phone conversation and especially liked learning about your firm. I understand that switching to value billing presents challenges and impacts your firm’s infrastructure. As promised, below are links to resources and materials that can help you better understand value billing.
Here is a short video, from Dionne, a fellow accountant, who talks about the tremendous impact value billing has had to her firm, and how it’s beneficial for both her and her customers.
Here is an article which further explains the pros and cons of this billing option.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I look forward to talking with you again soon.
Thanks for being a valued QuickBooks Online partner.
Kind regards,
