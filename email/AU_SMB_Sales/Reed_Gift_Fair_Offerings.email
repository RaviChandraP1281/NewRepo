Hi,

We recently attended Reed Gift Fair in Melbourne and have had many stalls come back and request further information on QuickBooks Online and how it would work for their business especially with our current discounts running. 

Due to the amount of requests, we cannot respond individually so we have organised two webinars outlining our product and its uses for Small to Medium businesses. If you would like to join into the webinar, please call our team in Sydney on 1800 917 770 to make a booking for you. The next session will be on Tuesday the 25th of August at 11am. 

We hope to hear from you soon,

Kind regards,
