Hi,

I noticed your trial account of QuickBooks expired and I really wanted to know how you found the software. Did you get to see much? Did it do what you needed it to do? Did you need help with anything?

If you're still looking for an accounting package to save time and money, please get in contact with me and I can help you quickly get set up.


Kind regards,
