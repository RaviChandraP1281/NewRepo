Hi ,

I noticed you signed up for a trial of QuickBooks Online. I wanted to touch base with you and introduce myself, my name's Thomas and I'll be your ongoing point of contact for product support. My landline and Mobile are in the email signature below, give me a call if you need any help with your trial or if you have any questions. 

On Thursday we have a comprehensive live online training session in using Quickbooks Online. This is run by a registered bookkeeper who is trained in using the product. I'd strongly encourage you to attend this live webinar as it will help get you up to speed and using Quickbooks efficiently, follow the link to sign up.
