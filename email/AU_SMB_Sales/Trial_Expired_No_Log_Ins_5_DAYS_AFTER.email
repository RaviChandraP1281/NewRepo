Hi,

Max from QuickBooks Online here again. 

Your trial has now expired and your data is scheduled to be deleted. 

Don’t be alarmed you are still able to gain access to the account to activate the subscription. 

If you don’t want to activate your current account and want to give it another trial first please just give me a call and I will help you get that organized.
