Dear {!Contact.Name},

We have received your company file for Data Recovery; however, we noticed the last transaction date doesn&apos;t match the case notes documented by our agent.

Please upload the most recent copy of your QuickBooks company file so we may proceed with your request as soon as possible. If this is the right file, please email us at icu_status@intuit.com including your Case ID to confirm this is the case to be worked on.

Note: Your quoted competion date will be affected by the amount of time you take to confirm the correct file has been uploaded or to respond to requests for additional information.

We will not process your request until we get a confirmation from you regarding the Last Transaction Date in the file uploaded for Data Recovery.

Thank you,
Intuit Data Services
