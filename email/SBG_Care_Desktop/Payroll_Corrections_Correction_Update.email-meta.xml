    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Name},

I have entered some information for your employees. Tomorrow I will continue to enter the rest of the information you requested.

You can review these changes in your audit history. I will do my best to complete the remainder of your request before the end of the next business day.

Feel free to contact me if you have any further information to provide and I will get back with you as soon as I can.

Warmest Regards,
