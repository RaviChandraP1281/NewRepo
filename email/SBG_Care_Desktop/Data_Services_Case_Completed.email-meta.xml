Dear {!Contact.Name},


Your Data Services request is now complete! Your repaired file is now available to be downloaded at your earliest convenience.



Before you download your file, please read the following:

There were two files uploaded by the Data Services representative:

Your repaired company file in one of the following formats:

Quickbooks Pro/Premier and Enterprise Solutions: Your company file as [Outgoing File Name].QBM (QBM is a portable, or compressed, copy of your file).
QuickBooks Mac: Your company file as [Outgoing File Name].qb201# (.qb201# where #### is the version of QuickBooks your file is returned in for example .qb2016).
QuickBooks Point of Sale: Your company file as [Outgoing File Name].QPB (QPB is a backup copy of your file).

A ReadMe.doc file with the following information:

How to restore the company file to be your new working file.
Any details on what was fixed in your file or deleted transactions you will have to re-enter.


The company Admin Password has been changed.

The password should be the letter A plus your Customer Account Number (CAN).
For example: A123465789.
Intuit recommends changing the Admin password as soon as you have restored your company file.

Any transactions entered in your current file will need to be re-entered in the repair file.
If you were able to work in your company file while data services was fixing a copy, you are responsible for re-entering this information into your repaired file.
Merging company files or transactions cannot be done by Intuit.
