Dear {!Contact.Name},


Your Data Services request has been submitted on {!Case.CreatedDate}.

Your company file must be received by [Upload Deadline]. This is to ensure cases are completed in a timely manner. Failure to do so will result in your case being closed. An email will be sent 2 business days prior to the closing of your case, to remind you of the deadline. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

During the data recovery process, you will need the following information to upload, download, and access your repaired file. The credentials are case sensitive so it might be best to copy and paste from your email(s).
