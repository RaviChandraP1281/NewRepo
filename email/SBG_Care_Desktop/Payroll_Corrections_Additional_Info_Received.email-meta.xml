    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Name},

I have received the corrections document you uploaded. I will now begin working on your account.

Typically requests take less than a day to complete. If I exceed this expectation, I will let you know where I am at by the end of each business day until I am done.

Feel free to contact me if you have any further information to provide and I will get back with you as soon as I can.

Warmest Regards,
{!Case.Case_Owner_First_Name__c}
