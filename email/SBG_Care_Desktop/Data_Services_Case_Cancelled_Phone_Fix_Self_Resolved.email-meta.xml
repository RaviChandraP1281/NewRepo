Dear {!Contact.Name},


A Data Services request was created on {!Case.CreatedDate}.

We&apos;ve were able to resolve the issue with you over the phone, or you notified us the issue was resolved without our assistance. At this time, there is no additional work we will perform on the company file uploaded to our team. Your file will be in queue to be removed from our system.

Your escalated case to our team is now closed.

Thank you,
Intuit Data Services
