Dear {!Contact.Name},

Unfortunately we were unable to repair your damaged file.  While we are able to address issues in more than 95% of all cases, the damage in your file is not a type that our tools have encountered and are capable of repairing.  At this time we recommend starting a new file or working with a valid backup file if you have that available.  This case is now being closed as “unrecoverable”.  The file will be destroyed once our engineering team has an opportunity to review the case in an effort to develop more effective repair tools.

We sincerely regret the inconvenience this has caused!

Thank you,
Intuit Data Services
