Dear {!Contact.Name},


We left you a voicemail or contacted you at [Locally Relevant Date/Time].



We&apos;ve been preparing your financial data to migrate over to your Quickbooks company. Unfortunately, it&apos;s taking longer than we expected and won&apos;t be able to meet our quoted date [Date/Time Quoted].



There is nothing to be concerned about as delays are common. They&apos;re normall caused by large files, or the complexity of the data.


{!Case.OwnerFirstName} will continue to keep you updated on your file.



Looking for a Status Update!



We recommend visiting the “Data Services Case Status Information” page. You will need the information you received from your welcome email with “SBG Data Services” in the subject line. It contains the information you’ll need to log in and see where your case is at in the recovery process.


You can also leave a message directly to the specialist working on your case, or provide additional information.



Data Services responds to emails Monday through Friday between the hours 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM PST.






Thank you,

Intuit Data Services
