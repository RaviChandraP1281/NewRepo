See data the way you want with the most  customizable reporting tools in QuickBooks. Enterprise Solutions offers the most flexible  reporting capabilities in QuickBooks. Twice as many custom data fields as in  other QuickBooks products, plus the ability to combine reports from multiple  company files (1) gives you the advantage of clearer business insights.  For more complex reporting needs, you can create custom reports with  ODBC-compliant applications by connecting directly to the QuickBooks database  for maximum flexibility in report design.(2)

Get a whole new level of control over user  access.  Enterprise  Solutions lets you safeguard sensitive business data by giving employees access  to the specific information they need to do their jobs.
