            <br />
      Thank you  for your interest in Intuit QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions.  We are dedicated to providing leading edge,  easy to use business management solutions.  </p>
        <p>QuickBooks  Enterprise Solutions 11.0 delivers the advanced functionality to meet complex  business needs, at a cost per user comparable to or <em>even lower than</em>  QuickBooks Pro or Premier. </p>
        <p>You can have  a maximum of 3 users with QuickBooks Pro and 5 users with QuickBooks Premier.  Additional user licenses of QuickBooks Premier are available for $359.95 each.  The cost for a Premier 5 User license is $1,620.00. With QuickBooks Enterprise  Solutions, you start with 5 users.</p>
      <p>See how QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions cost of  ownership compares to your current QuickBooks software:</p>

      <p>Annual  Support, the QuickBooks Training DVD, and all the web-based services listed  above are included FREE as part of your first year Full Service Plan membership1.  In subsequent years, your 5 user Full Service Plan costs just $850 – which  includes your upgrade to the latest software version, plus all of the extras  listed above.</p>
      <p>When you add  up the Year 1 costs, along with typical services growing businesses like yours  need, Enterprise Solutions actually costs less per license compared to Pro 3 User or Premier  3 User.  </p>
      <p>Thank you  again for your interest in QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions.  If you have any additional questions, please  don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>
      <p>Thank you,<br />
       <br />
