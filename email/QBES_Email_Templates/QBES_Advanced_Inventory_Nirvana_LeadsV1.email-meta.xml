Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName}:

I am pleased to tell you about QuickBooks Enterprise  Solutions Advanced  Inventory (1) to help you efficiently manage inventory across your  business. Learn more at http://enterprisesuite.intuit.com/products/advanced-inventory/.

When you add Advanced Inventory, you’ll get these  sophisticated inventory capabilities right in QuickBooks with the same user  interface—there’s no need for separate software or data integration:

NEW! Bin Location Tracking
Track specific inventory items down to the bin location level within one or more warehouses. When filling out forms, automatically see quantities and serial or lot numbers for each bin. Sort pick lists and item receipts by location for efficient picking and stocking.

NEW! Barcode Scanning
Increase efficiency and reliability for all inventory  data entry by scanning items and serial numbers without touching a keyboard —  QuickBooks automatically puts the information into the right field. If you  don&apos;t have barcodes, QuickBooks will create them for you. Integrates with any  simple USB barcode scanner. (2)


Track Serial Numbers or Lot Numbers
Enter serial numbers and  lots at the time of purchase, transfer, or sale for more reliable tracking.  Plus, track defective lots through assemblies and subassemblies, in stock on  shelves, and customer purchases with new reports.


Use FIFO Inventory Costing
Get the flexibility to  track inventory using FIFO costing or average costing, and switch between the  two methods at any time. (3)

Know the value and quantity of inventory in multiple locations
For each location, you can see how many items are on hand, on sales  order, on purchase order, and your reorder point.

If you have questions about what Advanced  Inventory can do for you, I can help. Just call me  Mon-Fri, 5:30  am-5:30 pm PST.

Regards,

(1) Additional fees apply for the Advanced  Inventory add-on subscription. Requires QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 13.0  with an active Full Service Plan and an Internet connection.

(2) Barcode scanner sold separately.
