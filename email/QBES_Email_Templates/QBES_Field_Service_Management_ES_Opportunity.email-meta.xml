    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:

Thank you for your interest in Intuit Field Service Management ES!

Field Service Management ES will truly enable better communication and eliminate paperwork and bottlenecks - making everyone more efficient. We&apos;ve found that our customers who use Field Service Management ES:

Schedule more jobs: With real-time wireless updates from the field and automated online dispatch boards, you can quickly schedule and optimize work orders so that you can send your technicians to more jobs. Plus, with GPS tracking ability, you can easily see who is at what location and respond quickly to customer emergencies.
Get paid immediately: When a job&apos;s finished, the field tech creates an invoice on the spot and can accept payments by credit card. Data syncs wirelessly to QuickBooks, so payments are automatically recorded and reconciled.
Enjoy easier, more accurate payroll: Hours in the field are verified by GPS, linked back to the office and recorded in QuickBooks. Simply review and approve the timesheets for payroll1.
Eliminate double-entry: Increase productivity because there is no need to retype customer information, work orders, notes, invoices, and timecard or payroll information.

I will follow up with you as we discussed, if you have any questions in the interim, please contact me for anything you need.
