    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Your $20 Safety Net offer for this tax season.

If you’ve had difficulty in using your current software, whether it’s slow, unreliable, or just doesn’t work the way you want to work, we’ve developed a solution just for you.  For $20, you’ll have your tax year 2012 data converted... just in case you need to load it into ProSeries. We’ll also give you a license for the ProSeries 2012 product, loaded with $150 so you can try it out with your data.  That way, if something happens with your current provider, we can quickly transfer your 2012 ProSeries data into the 2013 product – you’ll be up and running in no time.

ProSeries is a cutting edge tax tool that thousands of accountants depend on for reliable, dependable results. It’s easy to use and quick to learn – we help you every step of the way.

    File tax returns faster using ProSeries’ 20+ time savings features, such as the Missing Client Information Tool that reduces the hassle of tracking down client data, or ProSeries Tax Import that automatically imports client data directly into 1040 returns.
    Entrust your firm’s reputation and client satisfaction with Intuit, America’s top accounting &amp; tax software provider.
    Get the in-product &amp; U.S.-based technical support (with extended hours during peak season) you deserve to ensure a smoother tax season.

I’d like to discuss how ProSeries can help your firm run more smoothly this tax season.

Call me at {!User.Phone} or let me know the best day and time you can be reached.
