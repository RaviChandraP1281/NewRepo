    <subject>We have your safety net offer ready now</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Your $20 Safety Net offer for this tax season.

If you’ve had difficulty in using your current software, whether it’s slow, unreliable, or just doesn’t work the way you want to work, we’ve developed a solution just for you.  For $20, you’ll have your tax year 2012 data converted... just in case you need to load it into Lacerte. That way, if something happens with your current provider, we can quickly transfer your 2012 data into the Lacerte 2013 product – you’ll be up and running in no time.

Lacerte gives you reliability backed by strong diagnostics, transparency of calculations, years of experience, and great support:

    More than 21,000 error diagnostics, including a specific e-File review, to help uncover mistakes or omissions, resulting in maximum refunds and fewer rejected returns. We’ve had new customers tell us after they switched to Lacerte that, thanks to Lacerte’s diagnostics, they’ve realized that they were preparing some returns incorrectly with their previous software.
    Know how calculations are derived with our Jump-To-Input feature. It allows you to you to go from a line on the form to the corresponding input fields in the detail screens, so there’s no black box. For example, with Jump-To-Input you can see and go to all 11+ sources of income that make up line 7 and easily navigate to them.
    No need to &quot;turn-on&quot; schedules. Lacerte’s powerful calculation engine includes over 5800 forms and will help you make sure you have the right forms in the return.
    The help you need how and when you need it – 100% toll-free U.S.-based support, available via phone or chat.
    Over 30 years of experience in the industry, and Lacerte is backed by Intuit’s proud history of tax and accounting leadership.

I’d like to discuss how Lacerte can help your firm run more smoothly this tax season.

Call me at {!User.Phone} or let me know the best day and time you can be reached.
