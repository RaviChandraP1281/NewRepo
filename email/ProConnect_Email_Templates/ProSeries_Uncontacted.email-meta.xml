    <subject>Now’s the Time – Take a Look at ProSeries</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I’ve tried contacting you before, but unfortunately we just haven’t been able to connect. Now is a great time to take a closer look at ProSeries®, as you file your tax season 2012 extensions and before the crush of the 2013 tax season arrives.  I’m certain that once you really understand what ProSeries can do for your practice, the decision will be easy.

Here are some of the reasons tax professionals like you decide to go with ProSeries:

-     File returns faster – with less hassle and more confidence.  20+ built-in time saving features like Missing Client Data Tool, ProSeries Tax Import, and Modernized E-File Support can save you valuable hours every tax season.
-     Backed by Intuit and used by more practices than any other.  With more than 65,000 practices, ProSeries is the leading professional tax software on the market today.  We have more satisfied customers than Drake, ATX, or TaxWorks.
-     New pricing options.  You asked for more competitive pricing, and we responded.  Now we have unlimited individual and business bundles, and pay-as-you-go options that give you the flexibility to pay for only the returns you need.  Plus, I can offer you special multi-year pricing to make your transition even more worthwhile. 

Our toll-free U.S.-based support is available right now to help you get up to speed, and throughout the tax season to ensure you’re getting the most out of ProSeries during your busiest times.  (In the final week of tax season 2012, our average wait time was only about 2 minutes!)

If you haven’t already decided on a tax software solution, let’s talk.  Drop me a line or give me a ring, and let’s chat about how ProSeries can benefit your practice.
