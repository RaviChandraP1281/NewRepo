    <textOnly>Intuit - ProSeries Tax

Hi {!Contact.Name},

We just got some new pricing for new customers you’ll want to hear about, but I haven’t had much luck getting in touch with you.

Give me a call and I can give you all the details.
My direct number is {!User.Phone}

If you are no longer interested in ProSeries, let me know that too.  You can just reply to this email letting me know:

I’m still considering ProSeries, give me a call.
I’m no longer interested in ProSeries for tax season 2013.
I’m not interested this year, but would like to consider it next year, keep me in your records.

Best wishes for a profitable and productive tax season!

Sincerely,
{!User.Name}

We have a new customer program that guarantees you’ll be season-ready on ProSeries in  30 days.
