    <subject>Intuit Lacerte Deferred Payment Option</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

You are receiving this communication because you recently applied for our Deferred Tax Option.  Three of the most common reasons that preclude eligibility for the Deferred Payment Option:  having an open balance past due, having an account on hold due to unresolved payment issues, and providing a non-sufficient funds check for payment.

Log in to My Account to select the payment option that works best for you.  Alternatively, contact us at: Lacerte 800-765-7777 if you would like to add additional products to your license.

Thank you for choosing Lacerte Tax.  We value you as a customer.



Sincerely,

The Lacerte Team

Intuit ProConnect Group</textOnly>
