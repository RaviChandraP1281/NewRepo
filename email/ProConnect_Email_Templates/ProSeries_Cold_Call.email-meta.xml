    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

More than 65,000 tax pros trust ProSeries. If you’ll give me just two minutes of your time, I’d love to discuss your current tax software.  We’re interested to hear about what works for you and what doesn’t. And I’d like to share some features in Intuit ProSeries that I think will benefit your firm by making returns faster to process.

Once I better understand your situation and your specific needs, I’ll be able to address questions I’m sure you have like...

What was the availability and response time of your technical support team last tax season? 
Do you have data conversion for my current software and if so, what can be converted? 
Do you have a solution that fits my budget? 
Tutorials and live webinars that will help you make the most of your evaluation period are just a click away. And you can always contact me to get you headed in the right direction.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.  Let me know if there’s a time that works best for you. 
 
Regards,
