    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thanks for your interest in ProSeries® Tax software! Congratulations, you’ve already taken the first step in becoming compliant with the IRS by looking into using a professional tax software, but did you know that you have to register as a small business and an eFile preparer? No need to worry – I’m here to personally help you if you have any questions about the process. This is standard protocol and easy to do; it takes the IRS about 30-45 days to process the requests.  That’s why I’d like to speak with you as soon as possible, so I can walk you through the 3 steps needed to become a professional tax preparer.

I also wanted to make you aware that ProSeries is built on the same platform as TurboTax. This means that you upgrade your tax software, all your client data will flow over smoothly and quickly, helping you to be up and running in no time.

Call me directly at {!User.Phone} or let me know the best day and time you can be reached, and I’ll help  get you compliant and up-and-running in no time.

Regards,
{!User.Name}
