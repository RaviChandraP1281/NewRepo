    <textOnly>Intuit - ProSeries Tax

Dear {!Contact.Name},

If your current tax software should be easier to use for the price you pay, then I invite you to take a look at ProSeries.

ProSeries has simple data input that makes navigating the tax program very easy.  And, it has exclusive QuickBooks integration.

Please call me at {!User.Phone} so I can give you more information.

Sincerely,
{!User.Name}

We have a new customer program that guarantees you’ll be season-ready on ProSeries in  30 days.
