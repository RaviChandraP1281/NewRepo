Dear {!Contact.Name},

My name is {!User.Name} with Lacerte Tax software. You contacted  our department inquiring about our tax program. To expedite your request I need  to speak to you for less than 2 minutes. During our conversation I&apos;ll walk you  through the evaluation process so you can make a go/no go decision quickly and  painlessly. When is a good time for us to speak?

You can call me at {!User.Phone} or reply back with your number and best time to reach you.


Sincerely,
{!User.Name}

We have a free webinar live every Monday, Wednesday and Friday that  shows the differences between Lacerte and your current software.
