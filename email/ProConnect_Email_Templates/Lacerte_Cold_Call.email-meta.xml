    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I know that your reputation means everything to your business. If you’ll give me just two minutes of your time, I’d love to discuss your business and current tax software. I am interested to hear about what works for you and what doesn’t. And I’d like to share some features in Lacerte that I think will benefit your firm by offering the speed, reliability and support you need to maintain your solid reputation.

Once I better understand your situation and your specific needs, I’ll be able to address questions I’m sure you have like...

    What was the availability and response time of your technical support team last tax season?
    Do you have data conversion for my current software and if so, what can be converted?
    Do you have a solution that fits my budget?

I can also provide you with learning tools such as online tutorials and live webinars that will help you make the most of your evaluation period.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.  Let me know if there’s a time that works best for you.

Regards,
