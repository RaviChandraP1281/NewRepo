    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

You are receiving this communication because you recently applied for our Deferred Tax Program.  In order to be eligible for the Deferred Payment Option thee are certain qualification criteria. Unfortunately, you do not qualify.  If a customer has an account on hold due to unresolved payment issues, history of late pay and/or an open balance past due that will preclude eligibility for this option.

Log in to My Account to select the payment option that works best for you.  Alternatively, contact us at: Lacerte 800-765-7777 if you would like to add additional products to your license.

Thank you for choosing Lacerte Tax.  We value you as a customer.



Sincerely,

The Lacerte Team

Intuit ProConnect Group</textOnly>
