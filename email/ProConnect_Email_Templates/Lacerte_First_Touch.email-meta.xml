    <subject>Following up on your Lacerte Evaluation</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}, 

Thank you for your recent interest in Lacerte® Tax! I understand you requested a free evaluation copy of our tax software and I’d love to speak with you regarding your practice and learn what is prompting you to shop for new tax software in the first place. 

Once I better understand your situation and your specific needs, I’ll be able to address questions I’m sure you have like… 

What was the availability and response time of your technical support team last tax season? 
Do you have data conversion for my current software and if so, what can be converted? 
Do you have a solution that fits my budget? 

I can also provide you with learning tools such as online tutorials and live webinars that will help you make the most of your evaluation period. 

I look forward to speaking with you soon. Let me know if there’s a time that works best for you.
