    <subject>ProSeries Wants You Back</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}:

We were very sorry to lose you as a ProSeries® customer.  Was your last tax season a good one, and did you get the product reliability and support that you needed?  I know some customers who have switched to competitive solutions have had less than ideal experiences, sometimes even critical failures that were difficult to overcome.

If you’re having second thoughts about your current solution, let me remind you why tax professionals continue to choose ProSeries:

-     New pricing options.  You asked for more competitive pricing, and we responded.  Now we have unlimited individual and business bundles, and pay-as-you-go options that give you the flexibility to pay for only the returns you need.  Plus, I can offer you special multi-year pricing to make your transition even more worthwhile. 
-     File returns faster – with less hassle and more confidence.  20+ built-in time saving features like Missing Client Data Tool, ProSeries Tax Import, and Modernized E-File Support can save you valuable hours every tax season.
-     Backed by Intuit and used by more practices than any other.  With more than 65,000 practices, ProSeries is the leading professional tax software on the market today.  We have more satisfied customers than Drake, ATX, or TaxWorks.

Our toll-free U.S.-based support is available right now to help you get back up to speed, and throughout the tax season to ensure you’re getting the most out of ProSeries during your busiest times.  (In the final week of tax season 2012, our average wait time was only about 2 minutes!)

We want you back.  If you have the any doubt that you made the right decision to leave, we should talk.  Drop me a line or give me a ring, and let’s explore how ProSeries can benefit your practice once again.
