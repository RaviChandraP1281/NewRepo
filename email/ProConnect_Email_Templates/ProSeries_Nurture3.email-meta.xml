    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Greetings! I thought you&apos;d appreciate these articles. The first is a veteran ProSeries® customer&apos;s take on the product&apos;s &quot;best kept secrets&quot;. The second article looks beyond tax software and discusses some of the other business applications that can enhance the productivity of tax and accounting professionals.

 Best Kept Secrets About ProSeries
When I was asked to write this article, I was a little intimidated … what are the &quot;best kept secrets&quot; in ProSeries? Do I even know them? Then, I realized, like any other program, there are features we learn about and remember, features we learn about and don&apos;t remember and features that we don&apos;t learn about at all...
