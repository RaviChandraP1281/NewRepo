    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thanks for your interest in ProSeries® Tax! We’re here to help you ever step of the way – from making it easy to become a professional preparer to helping you impress your clients.

You probably know that you have to register as a small business and eFile preparer, but did you know that it takes the IRS 30-45 days to process the requests? We&apos;re here to help you through the steps to become a professional tax preparer.

Call me at {!User.Phone} or let me know the best day and time to reach you, and we’ll get you compliant &amp; ready for tax season in no time.
