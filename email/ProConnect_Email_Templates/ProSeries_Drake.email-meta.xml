    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Are you 100% satisfied with your current tax software provider?

Here are the top 3 Issues from Drake customers (based on AICPA 2013 Tax Software Survey*) –

    Accuracy concerns…unsure of where errors occur?
    Hard to Use... quirky calculations?
    Lack of features/comprehensiveness... outdated systems?

How Intuit ProSeries can help you solve these issues:

    Enhanced, return specific diagnostics that appear where the error occurs to easily catch and help eliminate errors.
    Transparency in calculations so that there is no “black box” or behind the scenes calculations.
    Streamlined, easy-to-use interface with 20+ time-saving features allow you to work smarter and faster, such as the Missing Client Information Tool that reduces the hassle of tracking down client data, or ProSeries Tax Import that automatically imports client data directly into 1040 returns.
    Modern data entry methods to help speed your input, like the Forms-based data input (shows you what the return looks like so you don’t have to flip back and forth between input sheets and the real return).
    Flexible pricing options so you can get the quality ProSeries product at a price closer to your current provider.

If you’ve had difficulty in using your current software, whether it’s unreliable, has quirky calculations, or you’re simply curious how much time you would save, I’d like to discuss how ProSeries can help.

Call me at {!User.Phone} or let me know the best day and time you can be reached.

&quot;You get what you pay for - we used ProSeries for 7 years, then moved to Drake to save a few bucks, but you get what you pay for so we switched back from Drake to ProSeries last year and were happy&quot;.
