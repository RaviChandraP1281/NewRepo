    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you again for your business &amp; for joining the ProSeries team. A critical first step for success is to sign up for a new client services webinar to get your firm setup. These webinars are scheduled for 2 hours. In the first hour, we will share on-boarding information including data conversion. 

In the second hour, we will cover return preparation training. Additionally, you will receive an invitation to a 30 minute one-on-one session after attending the webinar. Below is the link to choose the time that best works for you.
