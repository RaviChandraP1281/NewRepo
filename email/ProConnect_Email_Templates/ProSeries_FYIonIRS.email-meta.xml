Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thanks for your interest in ProSeries Tax software.  I wanted to make sure you have the information you need to have a successful 2013 tax season.  Below is some information about IRS regulations that affect paid tax preparers.  You may already be aware of these but just in case, I did not want any of these to catch you off guard.

Important IRS requirement information you should know
IRS regulations require all paid tax return preparers to apply for a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) — even those who already have one. Apply for your PTIN.

The IRS law requires many paid tax return preparers to electronically file federal income tax returns prepared and filed for individuals, trusts, and estates.  For tax year 2012 you must efile the returns if the preparer anticipates filing 11 or more 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ and 1041 during the year. Start the process of getting an EFIN. It is important not to delay in getting your EFIN. If you take the following steps in the link provided it is possible for you to get your EFIN number within 4 to 6 weeks.

I look forward to working with you. If there’s anything I can do to help you during your evaluation process, please call me at directly at {!User.Phone} or email me at {!User.Email}

Sincerely,
{!User.Name}

We have a new customer program that guarantees you’ll be season-ready on ProSeries in  30 days.
