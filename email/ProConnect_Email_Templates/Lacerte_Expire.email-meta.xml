    <subject>Lacerte Wants You Back</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}:

We were very sorry to lose you as a Lacerte® customer.  Was your last tax season a good one, and did you get the product reliability and support that you needed?  I know some customers who have switched to competitive solutions have had less than ideal experiences, sometimes even critical failures that were difficult to overcome.

If you’re having second thoughts about your current solution, let me remind you why tax professionals continue to choose Lacerte:

-     Speed through the toughest returns with relative ease.  27 built-in time saving features like Missing Client Data Tool, Schedule D Import Wizard, and Modernized E-File Support can save you valuable hours every tax season.
-     Complete and comprehensive to help you prepare virtually any return with confidence.  Includes over 5,500 of the most complicated forms across individual and business– including multi-state K-1s, consolidated corporations and publicly traded partnerships.
-     Reliability backed by strong diagnostics and support.  More than 18,000 error diagnostics, including a specific e-File review, to help uncover any mistakes or omissions resulting in maximum refunds and fewer rejected returns.

And you’ll be happy to hear we’ve returned to toll-free U.S.-based support to ensure you’re getting the most out of Lacerte during your busiest times.  (In the final week of tax season 2012, our average wait time was less than a minute and a half!)

We want you back.  If you have the any doubt that you made the right decision to leave, we should talk.  Drop me a line or give me a ring, and let’s explore how Lacerte can benefit your practice once again.
