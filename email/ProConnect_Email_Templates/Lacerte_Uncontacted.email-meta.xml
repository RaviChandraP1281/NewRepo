    <subject>Now’s the Time – Take a Look at Lacerte</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I’ve tried contacting you before, but unfortunately we just haven’t been able to connect. Now is a great time to take a closer look at Lacerte®, as you file your tax season 2012 extensions and before the crush of the 2013 tax season arrives.  I’m certain that once you really understand what Lacerte can do for your practice, the decision will be easy.

Here are some of the reasons tax professionals like you decide to go with Lacerte:

-     Speed through the toughest returns with relative ease.  27 built-in time saving features like Missing Client Data Tool, Schedule D Import Wizard, and Modernized E-File Support can save you valuable hours every tax season.
-     Complete and comprehensive to help you prepare virtually any return with confidence.  Includes over 5,500 of the most complicated forms across individual and business– including multi-state K-1s, consolidated corporations and publicly traded partnerships.
-     Reliability backed by strong diagnostics and support.  More than 18,000 error diagnostics, including a specific e-File review, to help uncover any mistakes or omissions resulting in maximum refunds and fewer rejected returns.

Our toll-free U.S.-based support is available right now to help you get up to speed, and throughout the tax season to ensure you’re getting the most out of Lacerte during your busiest times.  (In the final week of tax season 2012, our average wait time was less than a minute and a half!)

If you haven’t already decided on a tax software solution, let’s talk.  Drop me a line or give me a ring, and let’s chat about how Lacerte can benefit your practice.
