    <subject>Still Interested in Lacerte Tax?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Last tax season you contacted us because you were having second thoughts about your professional tax software.  Are you still in the market for a new, more reliable solution?  Now would be a great time to choose Lacerte® so you can start realizing the benefits as you finish tax year 2012 extensions, and as you prepare for the upcoming 2013 tax season.

As a reminder, here are some of the reasons tax professionals like you choose Lacerte:

-     Speed through the toughest returns with relative ease.  27 built-in time saving features like Missing Client Data Tool, Schedule D Import Wizard, and Modernized E-File Support can save you valuable hours every tax season.
-     Complete and comprehensive to help you prepare virtually any return with confidence.  Includes over 5,500 of the most complicated forms across individual and business– including multi-state K-1s, consolidated corporations and publicly traded partnerships.
-     Reliability backed by strong diagnostics and support.  More than 18,000 error diagnostics, including a specific e-File review, to help uncover any mistakes or omissions resulting in maximum refunds and fewer rejected returns.

And you’ll be happy to hear we’ve returned to toll-free U.S.-based support to ensure you’re getting the most out of Lacerte during your busiest times.  (In the final week of tax season 2012, our average wait time was less than a minute and a half!)

If you haven’t already found that ideal tax software solution, let’s talk.  Drop me a line or give me a ring, and I’ll be happy to tell you more about what Lacerte can do for you and your practice.
