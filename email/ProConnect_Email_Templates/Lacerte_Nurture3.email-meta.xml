    <subject>Why This Tax Pro Switched to Lacerte</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Greetings! I thought you&apos;d appreciate these articles. The first is a Lacerte® customer describing why he switched to Lacerte from a competitive product. The second article looks beyond tax software and discusses some of the other business applications that can enhance the productivity of tax and accounting professionals

 3 Reasons I Switched from ATX to Lacerte
Maybe you&apos;ve seen the Discovery Channel&apos;s TV show, &quot;Worst Case Scenario.&quot; In the show, the host explores options for dealing with life-threatening, worst-case scenario situations. Well I had my own, accountant&apos;s version of a worst case scenario this last tax season...  
  
 Business Apps You&apos;ll Love
Everyone is interested in finding a way to get more time back in his or her day. As accountants, especially, we must be diligent about our work processes. We earn goodwill with our clients by making any part of their work just a little bit easier... 

I hope your evaluation of Lacerte is progressing nicely. Let me know if you have any questions or need any help.
