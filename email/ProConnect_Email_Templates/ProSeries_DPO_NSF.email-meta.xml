    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

You are receiving this communication because you recently applied for our Deferred Tax Program.  In order to be eligible for the Deferred Payment option there are certain qualification criteria. Unfortunately, you do not qualify.  If a customer has provided a non-sufficient funds check for payment/chargeback that will preclude eligibility, we can no longer offer the Deferred Payment Option for the next two tax seasons (24 months).

Log in to My Account to select the payment option that works best for you.  Alternatively, contact us at: ProSeries 800-934-1040 if you would like to add additional products to your license.

Thank you for choosing ProSeries Tax.  We value you as a customer.



Sincerely,

The ProSeries Team

Intuit ProConnect Group</textOnly>
