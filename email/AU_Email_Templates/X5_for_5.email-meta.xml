Your special offer

A special offer just for you

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today.

To recap on our conversation, QuickBooks Australia is currently running a limited time promotion specifically designed to help accountants and bookkeepers move to the cloud. This offer includes 10 Quickbooks Online Plus subscriptions for only $1 each for the life of the subscription.

Due to the unique status of your firm, I&apos;m able to offer you 5 QuickBooks Online Plus subscriptions for $1 each per month. In addition, once you assign these 5 files to your small business clients, you&apos;ll be able to access another 5 files, also at $1 each. All you need to do is assign all 10 files within 6 months.

To discuss this offer further or to proceed with the promotion, please call me directly on {!User.Phone} and we&apos;ll get started.

Kind regards
