Your special offer

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for talking just now and congratulations on your 5 for $5 purchase.

To recap on our conversation, due to the unique status of your firm, you&apos;ve secured 5 QuickBooks Online Plus subscriptions for $1 each per month. As a reminder, once you assign these 5 files to your small business clients, you&apos;ll be able to access another 5 files, also at $1 each. All you need to do is assign all 10 files within 6 months.

If you have any queries regarding this offer or would like to use our free data conversion service to help upgrade any existing clients, please call me directly on {!User.Phone}.

Kind regards
