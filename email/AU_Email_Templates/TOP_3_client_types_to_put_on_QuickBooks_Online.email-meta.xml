Top 3 client types for cloud

We recently quizzed a number of &apos;cloud confident&apos; accounting professionals on which small business clients they have been upgrading to QuickBooks Online. The results were really consistent and boiled down to three types:

That includes clients on BankLink, all types of desktop software, Excel, Word, paper-based records.

Why? Working online is more efficient and the $4.99 offer makes it very cost-effective

Typically start-up businesses using Excel, Word or paper-based records.


Why? The client needs a solution and the $4.99 offer makes it cost-effective

These are clients on QuickBooks 2009 or later, Reckon Accounts 2014 or earlier, including Reckon Hosted.

Why? Free conversion, client likes QuickBooks and the $4.99 offer makes it cost-effective


Further to these &apos;types&apos;, there are typical attributes or behaviours small businesses ideal for cloud accounting display. You can see them here &gt;&gt;

So if you’re looking for ways to save time and build your practice using cloud accounting this year, identifying and talking to your small businesses clients that fit the above criteria is a great start.

And if you need any help with your move to the cloud, please call the team on
