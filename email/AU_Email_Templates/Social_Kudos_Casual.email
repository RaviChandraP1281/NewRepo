Hi <Customer>,

Thanks for the great feedback on the satisfaction survey, so happy I could help!

If you have a minute to give me a quick shout out about your experience on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/QuickBooksAU) or Twitter (@QuickBooksAU) that would really make my day and at the same time get your business name out there.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to me or my colleagues anytime – we’re here to help!

Have a great Day!
