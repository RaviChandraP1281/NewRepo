Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We noticed you couldnâ€™t make it to our training session. We were looking forward to having you on-board as one of our Intuit ProAdvisors.

We hope that you can find the time to attend one of our training sessions in the future as we are certain that you can better your practice with our help.

This page will point you in the right direction for selecting another training session in the near future.

Thanks,
Intuit ProAdvisor Team
