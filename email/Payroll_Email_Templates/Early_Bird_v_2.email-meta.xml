Dear {!BLANKVALUE(Contact.Name, &quot;Valued Customer&quot;)}



Thank you for taking the time to discuss your business needs. I’m excited to help make sure your business stays compliant with our 1099 E-file Service. You can use the service to create electronic 1099-MISC forms to provide your contractors, as well as electronically file with the IRS.



Ready to get started?




Access the 1099 E-file Service now
If you use QuickBooks (Online Plus or Desktop), you can save time and import your data by accessing directly from the Vendor Menu
If you use Intuit Online Payroll, just start in Taxes &amp; Forms




As I mentioned in our conversation, we’re offering 20% off if you file by January 16th. It’s our way of helping make sure we don’t let the IRS deadlines slip by.



Finally, a reminder about a few key deadlines:




January 16th – Last day for Early Bird special pricing
February 1st – IRS deadline to provide copies to contractors
March 31st – IRS deadline to e-file your 1099-MISC forms




Thank you again – we look forward to helping you meet your 1099-MISC deadlines this year!

Best,
