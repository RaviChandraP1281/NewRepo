Regarding {!Case.Account}

We were contacted today with a request to transfer the Master Administrator Primary Contact of your QuickBooks Desktop account to another user. Since you are currently listed as the Master Administrator Primary Contact, the fastest way to complete this request is included in the steps below:

1. Sign in to Intuit QuickBooks Account Self Service Portal at (https://camps.intuit.com) using your Primary Contact login.

2. Scroll down to the Primary Contact section of the page.

3. Click the Change Button to assign a new Primary Contact.

4. If the user to who you want to designate the Master Administrator Primary Contact does not appear in the Authorized Users list, return to the main CAMPS page and under Authorized Users click the Invite a User Button. You need to input the First and Last Name, the email address, and a phone number for the user. The user will then receive an email invite. Once the user accepts the invite, you will be able to make the user the Primary Contact.

Log out.

6. If the user to whom you want to transfer the role does not appear in the drop-down list, click Cancel to return to Manage Users. You will need to make the desired user a Company Administrator. Make sure an email address is included for the user. These steps will generate an email to the person being invited to become the new Master Administrator. This person will need to accept the invitation in the email first before you can transfer the account.

7. Log out.

Important: The Primary Contact role transfer is not complete until the invitation is accepted by the new invitee. If you are unable or unwilling to transfer Master Administrator Primary Contact rights, the change may still occur if we are able to prove business ownership from the requesting party.

Sincerely,

The QuickBooks Desktop Support Team</textOnly>
