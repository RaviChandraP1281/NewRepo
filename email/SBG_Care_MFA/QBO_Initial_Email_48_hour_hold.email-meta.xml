Regarding {!Case.Account}

We were contacted today with a request to transfer the Master Administrator role of your QuickBooks Online account to another user. Since you are currently listed as the Master Administrator, the fastest way to complete this request is included in the steps below:
 
1. Sign in to QuickBooks Online (https://qbo.intuit.com) using the Master Administrator&apos;s user ID and password.
2. Click the company name on the top right. Under Your Company, click Manage Users.
3. Click Transfer Master Administrator. Note: If this button does not appear, you are not signed in as the Master Administrator.
4. In the Transfer To drop down list, select the name of the new administrator.
5. Click Finish.
6. If the user to whom you want to transfer the role does not appear in the drop-down list, click Cancel to return to Manage Users. You will need to make the desired user a Company Administrator. Make sure an email address is included for the user. These steps will generate an email to the person being invited to become the new Master Administrator. This person will need to accept the invitation in the email first before you can transfer the account.
7. Log out.
 
 
Important: The Master Administrator role doesn&apos;t get transferred until the invitation is accepted by the new person.
 
If you are unable or unwilling to transfer MA rights, the change may still occur if we are able to proof business ownership from the requesting party.
 
 
Sincerely,
The QuickBooks Online Support Team</textOnly>
