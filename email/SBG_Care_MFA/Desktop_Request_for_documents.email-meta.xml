Regarding {!Case.Account}

We want to help you resolve your Master Administrator Primary Contact Claim expeditiously. Intuit takes data security with the utmost importance in any determination made on a claim. We will need proof that you have legal rights to the QuickBooks Desktop account including subscription, products, and licenses. 
 
 
Please send the following documents so that we may verify ownership of the company: 
 
 
•	A current photo ID such as a state issued ID, driver license or passport
 
•	Proof of ownership document, such as Articles of Incorporation, Corporation Bylaws, and/or Shareholders Agreement etc.
•	If you are not the business owner, we can accept a signed letter from the owner or majority stockholder of the business (accompanied by their ID) stating his or her consent to assign the Master Administrator role to you.  
•	Proof that you&apos;re paying for subscription, such as a bank statement that shows the subscription payments, the account number and your name.
 
If your business structure does not have these exact documents or you are a non-profit we can accept the following in some circumstances.
 
•	A permission letter from the President or Board Members designating who should be the Master Administrator.
 
•	Recent board meeting minutes showing who should be the Master Administrator.
 
•	A notarized affidavit stating that you are authorized to be the Master Administrator.
 
 
Include the following information and attach it to this email: 

Case# {!Case.CaseNumber}

We will contact you within 7-10 business days once we receive this information. If we do not receive the documents within 7 business days the case will be closed. 
 
Sincerely, 
The QuickBooks Desktop Support Team
 
Note: 
In the event of a dispute between owners of the company, such as a dispute where each managing member/ business partner holds 50% ownership, we will be unable to make a determination on a Master Administrator claim and a court order may be required to reach resolution.</textOnly>
