Dear  {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for allowing me to assist you in your QuickBooks Online Account. It was a pleasure working with you today. 

While we’ve been discussing your issue I created a case to log in your call, and later document all updates on your case, which I will now close. What closing the case does is confirm the resolution of your issue. 
 
Did you know that 75% of QuickBooks Online users say working with an accountant makes their businesses run better?
 
Find the best one for your business by browsing our Accountants Directory (https://www.quickbooks.co.uk/find-an-accountant/). All our accountants are QuickBooks Certified Pro-Advisors, which means that they’re not only great at accountancy, but also at using QuickBooks.
 
Because your query has been regarding getting started with QBO, here are some useful articles on getting more familiar with QuickBooks Online (I imagine you already know most of them, but having them all in one place for further reference can't hurt):
